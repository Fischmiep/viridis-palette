# Viridis Palettes

This repository contains discrete GIMP color palettes for a selection of [Viridis family](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) color maps.
Besides GIMP, these palettes can be used for any program that supports the GIMP color palette format, such as Inkscape or Krita.

## Importing the palettes

To import a palatte, download the file named after the color map you want and import it to the tool of your choice.

**NOTE:** You may need to restart the program because the palettes are loaded once at startup.

### GIMP

Either copy or move the downloaded `.gpl` file to the `/palettes` directory indicated in the `Edit > Preferences > Folders > Palettes` settings menu.

### Inkscape

Either copy or move the downloaded `.gpl` file to the directory indicated in the `Edit > Preferences > System: User palettes` settings menu.
